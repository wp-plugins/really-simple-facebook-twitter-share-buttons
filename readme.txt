== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the difference between Facebook Like and Share buttons? =
Facebook Like's behaviour is similar to Facebook Share: it is a counter and if you click it a story is published inside your Wall on Facebook.
We suggest you to use Facebook Like because:
* it works better identifying title and text for the story to be published;
* it's the only one currently developed by Facebook.

= How about other social networks? =
We'll see!
